# VGA Integration

In this zip file you will find two VGA drivers you can use for your project.
The first one (`vga.c` and `vga.h`), will permit to switch to [VGA mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h) (320x200, 256 colors), set a palette and plot imported sprites.
The second one, Bochs Driver, enables a more powerful [graphic backend](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bochs_VBE_Extensions) with configurable screen size and color depth (from 8 bits per pixel to 32). 8 bit depth use the same palette logic as the VGA driver, 15 bits and more give you access to direct RGB color.

If you plan to use 4 or 8 bits palettes the next sections are the same between the two drivers.

## Palette array integration

Palette is the way to set custom colors in mode. For VGA each of the 256 colors can be set to a given 0-63 value (6 bits) for RGB, thus summing up to 262144 potential colors. Using the right palette is mandatory to draw faithfully a sprite. It can be changed at runtime.

The example palette `palette_vga` in [sprite.cpp](support/vga/sprite.cpp) is provided ([atari-8-bit-family-gtia.pal](support/vga/atari-8-bit-family-gtia.pal) file) but of course you can change it.

```bash
python support/vga/palette.py atari-8-bit-family-gtia.pal
```

Then integrated the generated array in your code, and use the function 

## Sprite array integration (with palette)

Sprites are included as unsigned char arrays, of the size of the sprite (ex: 32x32). 
The [sprite.py](support/vga/sprite.py) script permits to generate the needed array (and potentially palette) from a PNG file (only). 
It is adviced to use a given palette (as each sprite will share it on the same screen). Origin colors will be quantized at best to 

```bash
python support/vga/sprite.py file.png -p atari-8-bit-family-gtia.pal # if you are using this palette in your code
```

Then, include the generated array in your code and use the `draw_sprite` with it.

## Usage in code

Include [vga.h](vga.h) and [sprite.h](sprite.h)
Copy the necessary arrays for palette and sprites.

Use the following code (for instance on key pressed): 
```cpp
set_vga_mode13(); // set VGA mode
set_palette_vga(palette_vga); // set to given palette
clear_vga_screen(0); // put the color 0 on each pixel
plot_square(50, 50, 25, 4); // plot a square of 25 width at 50,50 of color 4
draw_sprite(sprite_door_data, 32, 32, 100,100); // draw the 32x32 sprite at 100,100
```

For the Bochs diver use the following snippet:

```c
// add these includes
#include <hal/pci.h>
#include <drivers/EcranBochs.h>

#include "sprite.h"

extern "C" void Sextant_main(unsigned long magic, unsigned long addr){
    // scan PCI bus to find VRAM address
    checkBus(0);

    EcranBochs vga(640, 400, VBE_MODE::_8);

    vga.init();
    vga.clear(0);

    // only usefull in 4 or 8 bits modes
    vga.set_palette(palette_vga);
    vga.plot_palette(0, 0, 25);

	int offset = 0;
	while (true) {
		vga.clear(1);
		vga.plot_sprite(sprite_data, SPRITE_WIDTH, SPRITE_HEIGHT, offset, 200);
		offset = (offset+1) % (640);
		vga.swapBuffer(); // call this after you finish drawing your frame to display it, it avoids screen tearing
	}
}
```

### RGB access with Bochs driver

The Bochs drivers allows you to have more than 256 colors and choose custom resolution for your screen.

Here is a example that initializes the screen in 32 bits color depth and plays a simple animation using the `pain(x, y, r, g, b)` function.
Note that you will need to write the logic to draw sprites yourself (but it's very similar to vga driver).

```c
#include <hal/multiboot.h>
#include <hal/pci.h>
#include <drivers/EcranBochs.h>

#include "sprite.h"


extern "C" void Sextant_main(unsigned long magic, unsigned long addr){
	// scan PCI bus to find VRAM address
	checkBus(0);
	EcranBochs vga(640, 400, VBE_MODE::_32);

	vga.init();
	
	ui8_t offset = 0;
	while(true) {
		
		for (int y = 0; y < vga.getHeight(); y++) {
			for (int x = 0; x < vga.getWidth(); x++) {
				vga.paint(x, y, 
					(~x << y%3) + offset & y, 
					~offset * (x & ~y), 
					offset | (~y < 2 - x % 16));
			}
		}
		++offset;
	}
}
```

### "Transparent" color

It is assumed in `draw_sprite` that the transparent color (not drawed) is the 255. You can change this at ease. Don't forget to take that into account in your sprites!
